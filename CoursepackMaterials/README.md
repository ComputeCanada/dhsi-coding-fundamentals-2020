This folder contains the files that were compiled for the DHSI2020 coursepack.  It includes the syllabus (extracted from the main repository readme), the installation instructions for Anaconda on various operating systems (Linux, MacOX, Windows), and a copy of a textbook that introduces students to Python (Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist by Allen Downey). Students were expected to read the installation instructions and have Anaconda installed before DHSI and to use the textbook as something to refer back to after DHSI when they were attempting to consolidate their knowledge of Python or learn more about some aspect that wasn't thoroughly covered in the class (due to lack of time).
