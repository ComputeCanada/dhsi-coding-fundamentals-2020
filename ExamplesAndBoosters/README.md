This folder contains subfolders of in class program examples and project boosters from previous years of DHSI.
We walked students through the in class programs, while teaching them about specific coding techniques.
The "boosters"  were intended to help students create their own projects by allowing them to copy-and-paste relevant sections of code from similar examples. Some are in Jupyter Notebooks and some are in .py files, depending on the instructor's preference.
